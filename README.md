# RecipeRadar API

The RecipeRadar API provides data services to the RecipeRadar [frontend](https://www.github.com/openculinary/frontend) application.

It provides endpoints to support the following functionality:

* Recipe and ingredient search
* User feedback collection

The API has high uptime and availability requirements since it's a core part of the [frontend](https://www.github.com/openculinary/frontend) recipe search experience.
